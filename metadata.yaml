description: This comprehensive study of China's history and national character was
  published in 1922, after Russell had spent a year as Professor of Philosophy at
  the University of Beijing. It is an insightful, and in some ways even prescient,
  take on a country that seems destined to stand beside America as a superpower of
  the 21st century.
